<h1>My Hobbies</h1>

<!--All images in this file are my own original images-->
<p>Like many others, one of my hobbies is browsing the net. My favourite web is <a href="https://9gag.com/">9GAG.com</a>
. It has many halarious and attrative memes and content, in which some of them are quite a bit political-incorrect by today's standard.
Nevertheless, I enjoy browsing it in my spare time. This is one of the memes I created:</p>

<p>My other hobby is driving. I like the sense and feeling of freedom to go anywhere I want.</p>

<p>No, that is not my car nor I was involve in the accident. But it was my landlord who got crashed while someone rushed
through a red light. And I was there to be his translator towards the medics. This reminds me to keep caution all the time, 
especially driving through intersections even my light is green.<p/>

<p>Lastly, I am currently running a business or a franchise with other partners. This is more a thing I'm working on 
in the meantime instead of my hobby. You can see me in the picture when you scroll down in 
<!-- My website link--><a href="https://www.richmondhill.idealabkids.com/">our business website.</a> (I'm the middle guy with the blue shirt!)
It was a whole different level of learning experience in my life, and no, I'm not advertising my business.</p>
