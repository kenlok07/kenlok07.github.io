<h2><b>About Me</b></h2>

<p> I graduate from University of Waterloo studying Geography and Environmental Studies, mostly taking GIS related courses, 
hence taking this program from Fleming.</p>

<p> My undergrad project was some cool topic about Waterloo
<p>Sadly it was almost a year ago and basically I return everything back. It does not really teach me that much anyways.</p>
