<h2><b>About Me</b></h2>

<p> I graduate from University of Waterloo studying Geography and Environmental Studies, mostly taking GIS related courses, 
hence taking this program from Fleming.</p>

<p> My undergrad project was some cool analytic topic about Waterloo, researching a topic and build a GIS web map and MCA model from the ground up.
It was a very memorable and interesting project. It look something like this:</p>

<img scr"images/proj2.jpg" width="" height="" alt="screenshot2 of my project">
 
<p>Unfortunetly it was almost a year ago and some data was lost from my end, specifically the web map should have close to 10 layers, which now only one left. 
The following link is the web map me and my group create if you are interested to see:</p>

<p> And to make matter worse, I bascially forgot how to repair the map since it was so long ago I return everything I learn back to my professors.
The only impression I had was ArcGIS pro, which is where most of the analysis was done, was very hard and user-unfriendly to learn. 
Not only because we never learn ArcGIS Pro in undergrads but the UI and tools or features was so different from ArcMap. 
In other words, though the experience is fun, the learning from this project is not as satisfied because I don't think I can recreate the same map, at least not for now.
And I am here to make sure the same failure would not happen again in the project of the last term in Fleming. </p>
