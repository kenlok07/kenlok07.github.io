<h2><b>About Me</b></h2>

<p> I graduate from University of Waterloo studying Geography and Environmental Studies, mostly taking GIS related courses, 
hence taking this program from Fleming.</p>

<p> My undergrad project was some cool analytic topic about Waterloo, researching a topic and build a GIS web map and MCA model from the ground up.
It was a very memorable and interesting project. It look something like this:</p>

<p>Unfortunetly it was almost a year ago and some data was lost from my end, specifically the web map should have close to 10 layers, which now only one left. 
The following link is the web map me and my group create if you are interested to see:</p>
